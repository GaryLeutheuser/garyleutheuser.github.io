I am a student at the University of Central Florida that likes all things computers, with a special place in my heart for practical topics such as software development. I also like to have a good laugh every once in a while.

I've found that discussing computers and their related ideas can get pretty dry, especially when learning. The result of this observation is this blog: I want a place to explore  and express my thoughts on coding and computer science in a lighthearted manner.

This site is built using Jekyll, and this theme is the base Jekyll theme.
