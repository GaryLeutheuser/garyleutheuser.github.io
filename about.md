My name is Gary Leutheuser - I am an individual that likes all things computers. I also like to have a good laugh every once in a while. Hopefully, these posts can be some form of respite from the myriad of ice-cold treatments that exist on the topics discussed.

I studied electrical engineering, and later computer engineering with an emphasis on software systems and algorithms. I could never make up my mind between hardware and software... so I didn't. I really enjoy working on software for embedded systems, which is what I do professionally.

Please note that this is a personal blog, and the opinions expressed are my own.
